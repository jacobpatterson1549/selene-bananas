    <span>To play, use tiles to form vertical and horizontal words that share letters.</span>
    <span>When a player runs out of tiles and all are connected, the  <em>snag</em> button should be clicked to get another tile.</span>
    <span>This also gives all other players a new tile.</span>
    <span>If a player cannot use a tile, the <em>swap</em> button can be clicked to exchange the tile for three others.</span>
    <span>When a player runs out of tiles and no tiles care left to be given, the <em>finish</em> button can be clicked to be scored.</span>
    <span>The scoring function determines if all of the player's tiles form a continuous block of English words.</span>
    <span>If successful, the player wins.  Otherwise, the player's possible winning score is decreased.</span>
