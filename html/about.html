        <li>Create or join a game from the <em>Lobby</em> after refreshing the games list. Any player can join a game
            that is not started, but active games can only be joined by players who started in them.</li>
        <li>After all players have joined the game, click the <em>Start</em> button to start the game.</li>
        <li>Arrange unused tiles in the game area form vertical and horizontal English words.</li>
        <li>Click the <em>Snag</em> button to get a new tile if all tiles are used in words. This also gives all other players a
            new tile.</li>
        <li>Click the <em>Swap</em> button and then a tile to exchange it for three others.</li>
        <li>
            <span>When a player runs out of tiles and no tiles are left to be given, the <em>Finish</em> button can be
                clicked to be scored.</span>
            <span>The scoring function determines if all of the player's tiles form a continuous block of English
                words.</span>
            <span>If successful, the player wins. Otherwise, the player's possible winning score is decreased and play
                continues.</span>
